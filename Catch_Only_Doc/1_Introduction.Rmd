##Map
A map showing the scope of the assessment and depicting boundaries for fisheries or 
data collection strata is provided in Figure \ref{fig:boundary_map}.

##Ecosystem Considerations
In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in the analysis. 
This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) 
that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.
