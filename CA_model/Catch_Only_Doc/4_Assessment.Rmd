##Model Description


###Transition to the Current Stock Assessment



###Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas
There are xxx fleets in the base model.  They include:

*Commercial*: The commercial fleets include ...

*Recreational*: The recreational fleets include ...

*Research*: There are xx sources of fishery-independent data available ...

###Other Specifications


###Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3 version 3.30.05.03 by Dr. Richard Methot at 
the NWFSC. This most recent version was used, since it included 
improvements and corrections to older versions.  The r4SS package 
(GitHub release number v1.27.0) was used to post-processing output data from Stock
Synthesis. 

###Data Weighting


###Priors
The log-normal prior for female natural mortality were based on a meta-analysis 
completed by Hamel [-@Hamel2015], as described under “Natural Mortality.” Female 
natural mortality was fixed at the median of the prior, 0.xxx for an assumed
maximum age of xx.  An uninformative prior was used for the male offset natural 
mortality, which was estimated.

The prior for steepness (*h*) assumes a beta distribution with parameters based on an update for the 
Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (Dorn, M. and Thorson, J., pers. comm.), which was endorsed by the Science 
and Statistical Committee in 2018.  The prior is a beta distribution with $mu$=0.xxx and $sigma$=0.xxx.
Steepness is fixed in the base model at the mean of the prior. The priors were applied in sensitivity analyses where these parameters were estimated.



###Estimated and Fixed Parameters
A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables 
\ref{tab:model_params}. 

The base model has a total of xxx estimated parameters in the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item xxx,
  \item xxx
  \item xxx, and
  \item xxx selectivity parameters
\end{itemize}

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a full list of 
all estimated and parameters is provided in Table \ref{tab:model_params}.

_Natural Mortality._ 

_Selectivity._

<!-- *********************MODEL 1 RESULTS********************************** -->
##Base Case Model Results 
The following description of the model results reflects a base model that 
incorporates all of the changes made during the STAR panel (see previous section). 
The base model parameter estimates and their approximate asymptotic standard errors 
are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood components are in 
Table \ref{tab:like_components}.  Estimates of derived reference points and 
approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}.
Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.



###Parameter Estimates

The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input 
variability) for all surveys was estimated within the model.  



(Figure \ref{fig:ts11_Age-0_recruits_(1000s)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals} ). 

The stock-recruit curve ... Figure \ref{fig:SR_curve2} with estimated recruitments also 
shown. 

###Fits to the Data
Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition, survey length 
composition, and conditional age-at-length observations are all discussed below.  


###Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Sensitivity 1
  
  \item Sensitivity 2
  
  \item Sensitivity 3
  
  \item Sensitivity 4
  
  \item Sensitivity 5, etc/
  
  
\end{enumerate}





###Retrospective Analysis



###Likelihood Profiles



###Reference Points
Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution 
among fleets in the most recent year of the model, (`r LastYR - 1`). Sustainable total 
yield (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt 
based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning biomass equivalent to 40% of the unfished 
level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` mt. 


(Figure \ref{fig:ts7_Spawning_biomass_(mt)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}

The `r LastYR` spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass 
is above/below the target of 40% of unfished 
levels (Figure \ref{fig:ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). 
The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, has been xxx the management target 
for the entire time series of the model. 

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base 
model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium curve based on a 
steepness value xxx.
